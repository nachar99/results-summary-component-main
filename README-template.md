## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility (ARIA roles, labels, and semantic structure)

### What I learned

- Improved layout centering using Flexbox
- Created responsive, accessible designs with semantic HTML
- Used gradients, shadows, and border-radius for modern UI polish
- Carefully managed font imports, spacing, and readability

Example snippet:

```css
.purple-wrap {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, hsl(252, 100%, 67%), hsl(241, 81%, 54%));
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 2.8125rem 3.375rem;
}


### Continued development

In future projects, Iâ€™d like to:
  Dynamically populate components using local JSON or APIs
  Improve responsiveness with media queries
  Try using CSS Grid for layout comparison
